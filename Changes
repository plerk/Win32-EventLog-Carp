Revision history for Perl extension Win32::EventLog::Carp.

1.21  23 Jul 2001
	- removed warning message when an attempt to register a custom event
	  source (using Win32::EventLog::Message) fails

1.20  12 Jul 2001
	- added test for die within an eval; death in an eval is no longer
	  reported in the event log by default
	- added LogEvals option to report failed evals in the event log
	- added note about forcing a stack trace in POD

1.11  20 Jun 2001
	- tested with Carp::Assert
	- added register_source() function

1.10   7 Feb 2001
	- uses Win32::EventLog::Message to register the source,
	  if the module is installed on the system
	- the registration and initialization of the event log handle
	  will be done in the _report() function
	- the event text now begins with the script's absolute path
	- the 'Source' in the event log is now the script's basename
	- NUL characters in event text are treated like newlines

1.00  10 Jan 2001
        - This version is a serious re-write!
	- Win32 events are posted by trapping __WARN__ and __DIE__ signals
	  (which means warnings and errors from most other modules used by
	  the calling program will be posted to the event log)
	- @ISA Carp
	- changed behavior of 'click' to use Carp::shortmess
	- carriage-return/newline combinations handled better in event text
	- blank lines in event text are ignored

0.04  7 Mar 2000
	- added a 'click' function for information messages
	- newlines in event strings converted to spaces
