REQUIREMENTS
      Carp
      Win32::EventLog

  Installation

      make install

HISTORY
    Changes since Win32::EventLog::Carp v1.00

    1.11  20 Jun 2001
	- tested with Carp::Assert
	- added register_source() function

    1.10   7 Feb 2001
	- uses Win32::EventLog::Message to register the source,
	  if the module is installed on the system
	- the registration and initialization of the event log handle
	  will be done in the _report() function
	- the event text now begins with the script's absolute path
	- the 'Source' in the event log is now the script's basename
	- NUL characters in event text are treated like newlines

    There should be no incompatabilities with past versions.

SYNOPSIS
      use Win32::EventLog::Carp;
      croak "We're outta here!";

      use Win32::EventLog::Carp qw(cluck);
      cluck "This is how we got here!";

DESCRIPTION
    `Win32::EventLog::Carp' traps warnings and fatal errors in Perl and
    reports these errors in the Windows NT Event Log. This is useful for
    scripts which run as services or through the scheduler, and for
    CGI/ISAPI scripts.

    The interface is similar to `Carp': the `carp', `croak' and `confess'
    functions are exported (with `cluck' being optional). You need only
    change references of "Carp" to "Win32::EventLog::Carp" to begin using
    this module.

    A more detailed description can be found in the module's POD docu-
    mentation.
