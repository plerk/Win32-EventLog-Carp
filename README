HISTORY
    Changes since Win32::EventLog::Carp v0.04

    1.00  10 Jan 2001
        - This version is a serious re-write!
	- Win32 events are posted by trapping __WARN__ and __DIE__ signals
	  (which means warnings and errors from most other modules used by
	  the calling program will be posted to the event log)
	- @ISA Carp
	- changed behavior of 'click' to use Carp::shortmess
	- carriage-return/newline combinations handled better in event text
	- blank lines in event text are ignored

    There should be no incompatabilities with past versions.

SYNOPSIS
      use Win32::EventLog::Carp;
      croak "We're outta here!";

      use Win32::EventLog::Carp qw(cluck);
      cluck "This is how we got here!";

DESCRIPTION
    `Win32::EventLog::Carp' traps warnings and fatal errors in Perl and
    reports these errors in the Windows NT Event Log. This is useful for
    scripts which run as services or through the scheduler, and for
    CGI/ISAPI scripts.

    The interface is similar to `Carp': the `carp', `croak' and `confess'
    functions are exported (with `cluck' being optional). You need only
    change references of "Carp" to "Win32::EventLog::Carp" to begin using
    this module.

    A more detailed description can be found in the module's POD docu-
    mentation.
