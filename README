NAME
    Win32::EventLog::Carp - for carping in the Windows NT Event Log

SYNOPSIS
      use Win32::EventLog::Carp;

      my $code = &something() or croak "Unable to do something";

      unless ($code)
      {
          carp "Nothing from something";
      }

DESCRIPTION
    Win32::EventLog::Carp is a wrapper for the Carp module so that
    messages are added to the Windows NT Event Log. This is useful
    for Perl scripts which run as services or through the scheduler.

    The interface is the same as Carp and it should function in the
    same way (though it hasn't been tested as thoroughly).
