SYNOPSIS
      use Win32::EventLog::Carp;
      croak "We're outta here!";

      use Win32::EventLog::Carp qw(cluck);
      cluck "This is how we got here!";

DESCRIPTION
    `Win32::EventLog::Carp' traps warnings and fatal errors in Perl and
    reports these errors in the Windows NT Event Log. This is useful for
    scripts which run as services or through the scheduler, and for
    CGI/ISAPI scripts.

    The interface is similar to `Carp': the `carp', `croak' and `confess'
    functions are exported (with `cluck' being optional). You need only
    change references of "Carp" to "Win32::EventLog::Carp" to begin using
    this module.

    A more detailed description can be found in the module's POD docu-
    mentation.
