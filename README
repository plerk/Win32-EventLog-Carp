NAME
    Win32::EventLog::Carp - for carping in the Windows NT Event Log

SYNOPSIS
      use Win32::EventLog::Carp;

      my $code = &something() or croak "Unable to do something";

      unless ($code)
      {
          carp "Nothing from something";
      }

DESCRIPTION
    Win32::EventLog::Carp is a wrapper for the Carp module so that
    messages are added to the Windows NT Event Log. This is useful
    for Perl scripts which run as services or through the scheduler.

    The interface is basically the same as Carp and it should
    function in the same way (though it has not been tested as
    thoroughly). You need only change references of "Carp" to
    "Win32::EventLog::Carp" to begin using this module.

    One notable exception is the addition of the *click* function:

      Win32::EventLog::Carp::click "Make a jazz noise here.";

    This outputs the message to STDERR without a stack trace, and
    allows scripts\ to post a simple "I have started" or "I am doing
    XYZ now" message to the log.

    All messages are posted the the Application Log we well as to
    STDERR.

REQUIREMENTS
      Carp

BUGS
    Any bugs in Win32::EventLog and Carp will lead to bugs with this
    module.
